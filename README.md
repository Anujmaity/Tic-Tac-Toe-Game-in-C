The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a console-based two-player game implemented in the C programming language and executed using the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) IDE with a C compiler extension. The game allows two players, Player X and Player O, to take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The program validates each move, updates the board, and checks for a winner after every move. If no winner is found and all cells are filled, the game ends in a draw.
